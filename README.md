Homework 4

Created two financial analysis tools with a single Jupyter notebook:

1. A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualise their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Results:

Total Savings(Crypto - $40992, Shares - $38361)

congratulations, you have enough money in your emergency fund.


2. A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

Results:

There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $97977.25 and $974313.09
